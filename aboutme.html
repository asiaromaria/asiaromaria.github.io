            Hey there! Thank you for being here! I'm Asia Romaria. I'm a Front-End Web Developer & UX Designer. But for better terms, UX Engineer. 
            My career started off with a big curiosity in software engineering. However, since I was into the social media/content creation space, I recommended
            to check out UX Design. Fast forward, I became a self-taught UX Designer. With a burning curiosity of programming, still, I decided to take a coding
            bootcamp, where I mainly focused on learning Javascript and the MERN stack. With these added skills, I am even more empowered to truly create 
            amazing digital products that I am passionate about. I love design, I also love coding. My goal in the industry is to become a powerful tech Unicorn!
            In my free time, I love to try new foods, travel the world, meet new people, take nice photos, and practice/indulge in self-care practices! 
            You can find me in your nearby boba spot, coding or practicing some new designs, or reading some kind of self-help book! My passion projects are anything to
            do with saas products, finance, e-commerce, or education. Thanks for reading this far, and hopefully we can meet in the near future! 
            <br>
            <br>
            Stay blessed,
            <br>
            Asia
        </p>
